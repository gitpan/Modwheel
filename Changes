      it's not finished yet anyway.
    - Cleaned up requirements. Reviewed required versions ++.
    - New requirement: UNIVERSAL::require.
    - No longer requires Crypt::Eksblowfish, but it's highly recommended to install atleast one

      Same for HTML::Tagset 3.03 - 3.10.

      Have to find out why my signature failes. in the mean time the dist is
      not signed.

      We used $ENV{CWD} to test if parseconfig managed to load absolute config
      file path names, but until we have a good way to make sure where the
      absolute path for the configfile will be on any system, we have to
      comment it out. So fixed for now.
