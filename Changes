      Fixed the plan bug in 00-YAML_valid.t.
      01-Modwheel.t did not skip enough tests when Test::Exception is not
       installed, also fixed.

      Have to find out why my signature failes. in the mean time the dist is
      not signed.

      We used $ENV{CWD} to test if parseconfig managed to load absolute config
      file path names, but until we have a good way to make sure where the
      absolute path for the configfile will be on any system, we have to
      comment it out. So fixed for now.
