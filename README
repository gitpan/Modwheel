Most web sites are pages categorized by topic. So web sites can be viewed as a
tree system where every page is a sub-tree and the page elements are nodes.
Page elements can be things like articles, links, ads, news, comments and so on.
In Modwheel a page-element is called an object.
You define your own object prototypes and then you define how to display these
objects with the representation engine. Objects can be displayed differently in
different contexts (pages) by using templates.
The only representation engine supported right now is the Template Toolkit,
but it wouldn't be much work to add support for others.
The project is in beta development stage but already has an admin interface
implemented in it and has been tested on Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD,
Ubuntu Linux, Solaris and Cygwin.
       
The current development version of Modwheel should work with MySQL, SQLite2 and
the Template Toolkit, although porting to other databases or templating
systems. shouldn't be much work. (Actually the SQLite2 port took less than 30
minutes).

* Installation

Modwheel uses the standard perl module install process:

    cpansign -v         # optional; see SIGNATURE for details
    perl Makefile.PL
    make                # or 'nmake' on Win32
    make test
    make install

Then you need to set up your modwheel directory:

    ./bin/modstrap install
    ./bin/modstrap configure

Note that the install script requires bash to run, it won't work in regular
sh.

Please see the file INSTALL if you want to do this manually.

* Notes for Windows users

If you are using Microsoft Windows, you will probably need the 'nmake'
utility before installation. It's available at:

    ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

If you are connected to the internet, "perl Makefile.PL" is capable
to automatically fetch it, and install into your windows directory;
all you have to do is to answer 'y' to this question:

    Required executable 'nmake' not found. Install it? [Y/n]:

However, if you are not yet online, or wish to install 'nmake' into
another directory, then please download the file manually, save it to
a directory in %PATH (e.g. C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND), then launch the MS-DOS
command line shell, "cd" to that directory, and run "nmake15.exe" from
there; that will create the 'nmake.exe' file needed by CPANPLUS.

You may then resume the installation process above, but replace 'make'
with 'nmake' in the last three lines.

* Operating Systems

Although it should run on any system that runs Perl, Modwheel has been
successfully tested on the following operating systems:
    
    Mac OS X 10.4.8 (x86).
    FreeBSD 5.3-beta4
    Ubuntu server 6.10 (Linux kernel 2.6.
