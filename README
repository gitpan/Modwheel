Modwheel is a publishing system for use with web, print, TeX, or what-
ever medium you have a need to publish in. It is designed to be very
extensible and will in the future have drop-in support for several
relational databases and presentation engines.

Modwheel is currently in a very early alpha development stage.
       
The current development version of Modwheel should work with MySQL and
the Template Toolkit, although porting to other databases or templating
systems. shouldn't be much work.

* Installation

Modwheel uses the standard perl module install process:

    cpansign -v         # optional; see SIGNATURE for details
    perl Makefile.PL
    make                # or 'nmake' on Win32
    make test
    make install

Then you need to set up your modwheel directory:

    bash bin/install.sh

Note that the install script requires bash to run, it won't work in regular
sh.

Please see the file INSTALL if you want to do this manually.

* Notes for Windows users

If you are using Microsoft Windows, you will probably need the 'nmake'
utility before installation. It's available at:

    ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

If you are connected to the internet, "perl Makefile.PL" is capable
to automatically fetch it, and install into your windows directory;
all you have to do is to answer 'y' to this question:

    Required executable 'nmake' not found. Install it? [Y/n]:

However, if you are not yet online, or wish to install 'nmake' into
another directory, then please download the file manually, save it to
a directory in %PATH (e.g. C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND), then launch the MS-DOS
command line shell, "cd" to that directory, and run "nmake15.exe" from
there; that will create the 'nmake.exe' file needed by CPANPLUS.

You may then resume the installation process above, but replace 'make'
with 'nmake' in the last three lines.

* Operating Systems

Although it should run on any system that runs Perl, Modwheel has been
successfully tested on the following operating systems:
    
    Mac OS X 10.4.8 (x86).
    FreeBSD 5.3-beta4
    Ubuntu server 6.10 (Linux kernel 2.6.
